## Simplificator

![Simplificator's values](/images/values.svg)

We are Simplificator, a software agency founded in 2007. Our purpose is to make life easier by developing sustainable software: easy-to-use, value-adding, long-term. We achieve that by working closely with our customers.

Our customer projects use a variety of technologies and we are always happy to experiment. We write Ruby, Elixir and Typescript daily and we've shipped an app in Elm. We automate with Ansible and Docker when we need to manage servers and rely on a headless CMS and GraphQL when we don't.

We are also polyglots in human languages. We keep official communication in German and English, but the team speaks at least 6 languages.

Our core values are:
- Keep it simple
- Love what you do
- Dare to question
- Collaborate closely
- Get things done
